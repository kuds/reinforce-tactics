## 🚀 Quick Start Testing

### Test Headless Mode (No GUI)

```python
# test_headless.py
from reinforcetactics.core.game_state import GameState
from reinforcetactics.utils.file_io import FileIO

map_data = FileIO.load_map('maps/1v1/beginner.csv')
game = GameState(map_data)

# Create some units
game.create_unit('W', 5, 5, player=1)
game.create_unit('M', 6, 5, player=1)

print(f"Player 1 units: {len([u for u in game.units if u.player == 1])}")
print(f"Player 1 gold: ${game.player_gold[1]}")

# End turn
game.end_turn()
print(f"Player 2 turn started")
print("Headless mode working!")
```

### Test RL Environment

```python
# test_rl.py
from reinforcetactics.rl.gym_env import StrategyGameEnv

env = StrategyGameEnv(map_file='maps/1v1/beginner.csv', opponent='bot')
obs, info = env.reset()

print("Observation space:", env.observation_space)
print("Action space:", env.action_space)
print("Grid shape:", obs['grid'].shape)
print("RL environment working!")

# Take a few random actions
for _ in range(5):
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
    if terminated:
        break

print("Episode completed successfully!")
```

### Test Training (Quick)

```bash
python main.py --mode train --algorithm ppo --timesteps 1000
```

### Test GUI Mode

```bash
python main.py --mode play
```

## 📝 Action Space Reference

The Gymnasium environment uses a MultiDiscrete action space with 6 dimensions:

| Dimension | Description | Values |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| `action_type` | Type of action | 0=create, 1=move, 2=attack, 3=seize, 4=heal, 5=end_turn, 6=paralyze, 7=haste, 8=defence_buff, 9=attack_buff |
| `unit_type` | Unit type for creation | 0=W, 1=M, 2=C, 3=A, 4=K, 5=R, 6=S, 7=B |
| `from_x` | Source X coordinate | 0 to grid_width-1 |
| `from_y` | Source Y coordinate | 0 to grid_height-1 |
| `to_x` | Target X coordinate | 0 to grid_width-1 |
| `to_y` | Target Y coordinate | 0 to grid_height-1 |

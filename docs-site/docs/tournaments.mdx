# Bot Tournaments

Welcome to the Reinforce Tactics Bot Tournament page! This page tracks official tournament results between different bot types, showcasing the performance of rule-based bots, LLM-powered bots, and trained RL models.

## What are Tournaments?

Tournaments in Reinforce Tactics pit different bot types against each other in a round-robin format. Each matchup consists of multiple games where bots alternate playing as Player 1 and Player 2 to account for first-move advantage.

### Tournament Format

- **Round-Robin**: Every bot plays against every other bot
- **Fair Play**: Equal games with each bot as Player 1 and Player 2
- **Map**: Typically played on the 6x6 beginner map for quick matches
- **Results**: Win/Loss/Draw records with win rate statistics

## Bot Types

### SimpleBot
A rule-based AI that follows a simple strategy:
- Purchases the most expensive units first (one per turn)
- Prioritizes capturing buildings and towers
- Attacks nearby enemy units
- Always included in tournaments

### MediumBot
An improved rule-based AI with more sophisticated strategies:
- **Maximizes unit purchases**: Buys multiple units per turn instead of just one
- **Coordinated attacks**: Plans focus-fire to kill enemies in one turn
- **Smart prioritization**: Captures structures closest to its own HQ first
- **Interrupts captures**: Attacks enemies that are capturing structures
- **Efficient combat**: Evaluates damage-per-cost to make better attack decisions
- Included in tournaments by default alongside SimpleBot

### AdvancedBot
A highly sophisticated AI extending MediumBot with enhanced strategic capabilities:
- **Inherits from MediumBot**: Builds upon MediumBot's proven coordinated attack and capture strategies
- **Enhanced unit composition**: Optimized purchasing (35% Warriors, 30% Archers, 25% Mages, 10% Clerics)
- **Mountain positioning**: Positions units on mountains before attacking for bonus damage
- **Smart ranged combat**: Prioritizes ranged attacks with Archers and Mages to minimize counter-attack damage
- **Special ability usage**: Effectively uses Mage Paralyze on high-value targets and Cleric Heal on damaged frontline units
- **Map awareness**: Analyzes HQ locations and defensive mountain positions on first turn
- **Aggressive tactics**: More aggressive attack prioritization and pursuit of enemies
- Included in tournaments by default alongside SimpleBot and MediumBot

### LLM Bots
AI-powered by Large Language Models:
- **OpenAIBot**: Powered by GPT models
- **ClaudeBot**: Powered by Anthropic's Claude
- **GeminiBot**: Powered by Google's Gemini
- Uses natural language reasoning to make strategic decisions

### Model Bots
Trained using Reinforcement Learning:
- Uses Stable-Baselines3 (PPO, A2C, or DQN)
- Trained through self-play and opponent challenges
- Learns optimal strategies through experience

#### Analysis

**Key Findings:**

1. **AdvancedBot dominance**: The AdvancedBot performed exceptionally well, achieving a 75% win rate and gaining +193 ELO. Its sophisticated strategies (mountain positioning, ranged combat, special abilities) proved highly effective.

2. **MediumBot solid performance**: With a 39.6% win rate and +75 ELO gain, MediumBot showed the value of coordinated attacks and maximized unit production over SimpleBot's basic approach.

3. **LLM bot struggles**: Claude Haiku placed last with only a 4.2% win rate (-173 ELO). This suggests that current LLM reasoning may not be optimized for the tactical decision-making required in this game format.

4. **High draw rates**: Many matches ended in draws, particularly on center_mountains.csv (defensive terrain) and between lower-performing bots. This indicates the game's strategic depth and defensive viability.

5. **Map influence**: AdvancedBot dominated on beginner.csv and corner_points.csv (100% win rate), while MediumBot actually outperformed on funnel_point.csv.

**Notable Observations:**
- AdvancedBot never lost on 3 of 4 maps
- The hierarchy is clear: AdvancedBot > MediumBot > SimpleBot/Claude Haiku
- Center mountains map produces the most draws (defensive terrain advantage)

## Insights and Analysis

### Strategy Patterns

As tournaments are completed, we'll analyze:
- Opening strategies and unit compositions
- Economic vs. military balance
- Successful tactical patterns
- Common mistakes and pitfalls

### Bot Strengths and Weaknesses

Each bot type has different characteristics:
- **SimpleBot**: Predictable but consistent; makes basic strategic errors
- **MediumBot**: More strategic than SimpleBot; uses coordinated tactics and better unit purchasing
- **AdvancedBot**: Extends MediumBot with enhanced unit composition, mountain positioning, ranged combat prioritization, and special ability usage
- **LLM Bots**: Creative but sometimes unpredictable
- **Model Bots**: Optimized but may overfit to training conditions

### Map-Specific Performance

Different maps favor different strategies:
- Small maps (6x6): Fast, aggressive play
- Medium maps (10x10): Balanced economic/military
- Large maps (24x24+): Long-term strategy and positioning

## Tournament Archive

All tournament replays are saved and can be watched using the game's replay system:

```bash
# Load a replay file
python3 main.py --mode play --replay path/to/replay.json
```

Replay files include:
- Complete action history
- Game metadata (bots, map, duration)
- Can be analyzed programmatically

## Future Tournaments

Upcoming tournament ideas:
- **Map Variety**: Tournaments on different map sizes and layouts
- **Specialized Competitions**: Economy-focused, combat-focused, speed-run
- **Evolution**: Tournament of evolved/improved model versions
- **Human vs. Bot**: Special exhibitions with human players
